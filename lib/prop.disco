using Primitives

||| Decide whether a proposition holds, *i.e.* convert it to a boolean.
||| Note, however, that for some propositions this may run forever.
||| For example, `holds (forall (x:N). x >= 0)` will run forever
||| trying to check all natural numbers to see if they are all
||| nonnegative.
|||
||| If you want to use random sampling to check whether a proposition
||| *probably* holds, the `:test` command at the REPL will give you a
||| best-effort answer. For instance, `:test (forall x:N. x >= 0)` will
||| happily report that every natural number it tried was nonnegative.

!!! holds (true : Prop) == true
holds : Prop -> Bool
holds = $holds
