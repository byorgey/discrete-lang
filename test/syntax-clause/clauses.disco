-- An example of a function defined by pattern-matching clauses, with
-- multiple clauses and multiple arguments.

zipWithN : (N -> N -> N) -> List(N) -> List(N) -> List(N)
zipWithN _ []        _         = []

-- Another example of a function defined by pattern-matching
-- clauses. This one has the feature that it has the same name (ys) in
-- two of the clauses, which was causing problems for the way we
-- handle name resolution (the implementation of 'lunbinds' in
-- Desugar.desugarDefn was wrong).

append : List(ℕ) × List(ℕ) → List(ℕ)
append ([]    , ys) = ys
append (x::xs', ys) = x :: append(xs',ys)
